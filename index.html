        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Carissa Vega, a lifelong learner and storyteller with a passion for humanizing others and exploring the deeper questions of life. With over 20 years of experience in leadership within healthcare and medtech, I’m now navigating a journey that merges creativity, compassion, and purpose. My heart is set on helping others see their intrinsic worth, breaking down societal barriers, and exploring faith beyond traditional boundaries. I believe in the power of curiosity, humility, and love to shape a better world. When I'm not diving into transformative projects, you’ll find me soaking in nature, exploring the night sky, or sharing a cup of coffee with those I love.</p>
